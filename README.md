This repository is part of our report for the [C/C++ lecture](https://www.depinfonancy.net/cours-%C3%A9lectifs/ces7aj).

### Table of contents of this repository:
- Our report in French `rapport.pdf` is to be read first.
- The `kmeans` folder contains our own code for the K-means clustering.
- The `kNN` folder contains our own code for the K-nearest neighbor algorithm.
- The folder `NN-tutorial-miller` is to meant to be read before the folder `NN-iris-data`. We adapt the code for simulating a neural network in C/C++ for XOR data and in Iris data set.
